# tip_calculator

This is a simple tip calculator app, that I built as part of a Flutter mastery course I took on Udemy (Credit: Paulo Dichone) 
This course taught me the fundamentals of software design using the Flutter framework. This app was made to teach us how to 
handle state in Flutter, as well as container decoration, theming, how to use context and why, and how to build UI items, like 
slider bars and buttons.
